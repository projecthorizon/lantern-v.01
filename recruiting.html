              We approach recruiting through a different lens. We believe that
              the cost of a poorly placed candidate has exponentially
              detrimental effects a team, candidate, and the
              bottom line. Conversely, a “good fit” placement
              has exponential effects to the positive. While
              this isn’t new insight, our experience shows that
              most recruiters don’t spend the necessary time
              and effort to maximize “right fit” placement. We
              do.
              <br>
              <br> We work in collaboration with our clients to analyze
              the company culture, values, needs and team dynamics
              in order to first maximize their existing talent
              before we start bringing new candidates to the
              table. It has been our experience that identifying
              and thoroughly understanding a company’s needs
              and deficiencies leads to the greatest chance for
              success. We have found that clear, transparent
              communication is critical for success. To that
              aim, we carefully design all our engagements to
              ensure timelines, deliverables and expectations
              are clearly communicated and understood. Each engagement
              is a collaboration and partnership, we aim to operate
              as a natural extension of your core team with your
              long term success as our primary focus.
              <br>
              <br> It is in our best interest to commit to your long
              term success. Building and maintaining a deep relationship
              focused on your success is the best way to achieve
              our goals. We do this by:
